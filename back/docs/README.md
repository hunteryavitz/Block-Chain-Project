Here's an outline of what we'll do:

- Define the structure of a block.
- Create a method to compute a block's hash.
- Create a method to generate new blocks (adding them to the blockchain).
- Create the initial block of the chain (the "genesis block").
- Examine a block to check that it's valid in the context of the previous block.
